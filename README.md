## Overview
- This is really a good challenge I have applyed flex box in this challenge. It looks simple but little bit challenging.
### The challenge

- The main challenging part was centering this card component. It took me for while to get the point.

## My process
-My initial process was creating HTML structure This is where I make mistakes. It seems simple at first, but If your HTML structure is not good then you can not apply css styles to your elements properly. Once I created the HTML structure then I focused on layouting the component. 
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- When I saw this desing on frontendmentor I thought it was easy, but when i started writing code I took more time than i expected mainly If you take any project from any resorses firstly we need to understand the structure of the desing we can't go strait writing code. This is what i learned from this project.
